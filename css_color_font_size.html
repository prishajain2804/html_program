    <h3>Women's Day Article</h3>
    <p>
      In 1908, 15,000 women in New York went on strike because of low pay and
      terrible conditions in the factories where they worked. The following
      year, the Socialist Party of America organised a National Women's Day, and
      one year after that, there was a conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, about
      equality and women's right to vote. In Europe, the idea grew and became
      International Women's Day (IWD) for the first time in 1911 and the United
      Nations declared 8 March International Women's Day in 1975.
